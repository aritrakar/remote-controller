# remote-controller

This is a Python script I wrote in collaboration with @souritrakar to relay commands from a PlayStation controller on my end to a web-server hosted on another (@souritrakar's) end, with the objective being to control a Xbox remotely.

**Note:** As expected, the latency between the request and the response was too high to play games like FIFA in (near) real-time, which was the intended purpose.
